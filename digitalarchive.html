                    Hi, I'm Cade. As a student in UCI's Humanities Core course, an aspiring developer, and an active consumer of content in my everyday life, I aim to use this website as an organized, multimodal collection of media and ideas that connect to this year's theme, worldbuilding, as I explore new academic and personal experiences throughout the duration of this course.
                </div>
                <br><br>
                <div style="display: flex;">
                    <div style="width: 70%; padding-right: 2%;">
                        Currently, I'm a reader of science fiction novels, a fan of uncommon music genres, and a player of puzzle games, all of which have contributed to my understanding of worldbuilding. With each new author, artist, book, or level comes an entire world, patched together by details or painted in sweeping strokes, through the creation of these works. My sense of worldbuilding has also been shaped by my real-life travels: my trips to Thailand, Cambodia, and Japan, hikes through the Sierra Nevada mountains, summer drives into Malibu sunsets, and visits to nearby college campuses. Again, each location and each experience unveils a different perspective on this vast world.
                        <br><br><span class="minihead">Right: a photo I took in 2024 in Shinjuku's Golden Gai district, which had a strong atmosphere and felt like stepping into a different world</span>
                    </div>
                    <div style="width: 30%;">
                        <img src="static/digital_archive/images/20240826_ShinjukuGoldenGai_Edit.jpg" style="width: 100%">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <br><br>That said, while I often considered worldbuilding to be an integral part of my favorite franchises, I rarely saw those experiences in my life through that lens until now. Even in the first few lectures, in which professors Alexander and Giannopoulou introduced the topic, I found myself surprised at how many of the places I have visited and communities I have been a part of could be considered worlds of their own. Thus, through my time in Humanities Core, I aim to document that new knowledge and understanding through the evolution of this website; I hope to open up yet another way of seeing this world, and the many other worlds that we build within it.
