                    <hr>
                    Hi, I'm Cade. As a student in UCI's Humanities Core course, I aim to use this website as an organized, multimodal collection of media and ideas that connect to this year's theme, worldbuilding, as I explore new academic and personal experiences throughout the coming months.
                </div>
                <br><br>
                <div style="display: flex;">
                    <div style="width: 70%; padding-right: 2%;">
                        Currently, I'm a reader of science fiction novels, a fan of electronic music genres, and a player of puzzle games, all of which have contributed to my understanding of worldbuilding. With each new author, artist, track, or level comes an entire world, patched together by details or painted in sweeping strokes, through the creation of these works. My sense of worldbuilding has also been shaped by my real-life travels: my trips to Thailand, Cambodia, and Japan, hikes through the Sierra Nevada mountains, summer drives into Malibu sunsets, and visits to nearby college campuses. Again, each location and each experience unveils a different perspective on this vast world.
                        <br><br><span class="minihead">Right: a photo I took in 2024 in Shinjuku's Golden Gai district, which had a strong atmosphere and felt like stepping into a different world</span>
                    </div>
                    <div style="width: 30%;">

                    </div>
                </div>
                <br>
                <div style="display: flex;">
                    <div style="width: 30%;">
                        <iframe width="100%" height="200px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bdaueM_DRi4?si=knO_3ljfGNFTQHbz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" style="border-radius: 8px;"></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <div style="width: 70%; padding-left: 2%;">
                        That said, while I often considered worldbuilding to be an integral part of my favorite franchises, I rarely saw those experiences in my life through that lens until now. Even in the first few lectures, in which professors Alexander and Giannopoulou introduced the topic, I found myself surprised at how many of the places I have visited and communities I have been a part of could be considered worlds of their own. Thus, through my time in Humanities Core, I aim to document that new knowledge and understanding through the evolution of this website; I hope to open up yet another way of seeing this world, and the many other worlds that we build within it.

                After spending two quarters building up this archive, I've started to understand how worldbuilding can be found not only through history and literature, but also through many different mediums of expression and even my own lived experiences. By frequently connecting topics from class to my interests, like technology, games, and life at UCI, I'm noticing how interlinked forms of expression really are.
                <br><br>My archive and my time in Humanities Core has helped me understand that every work is, either consciously or subconsciously, influenced by the times, experiences, beliefs, and habits of its creator. It's possible to find Plato's philosophy, for instance, in The Matrix, despite them thousands of years apart. In my archive, I have tried to describe such interconnections, contrasts, and influences to show how every work that we create not only builds its own world, but also contributes to countless other worlds in the future. Even these archives might serve as subconscious inspirations for classmates, influencing the worlds that they create.
                <br><br>As a whole, I hope to continue finding connections between the topics we learn about, and though I am not fully sure what I will research in the Spring, I hope to incorporate many such connections to demonstrate how we all contribute together to building worlds.

                This website is built in pure JS/HTML/CSS and statically hosted on GitHub pages. I chose this over Google Sites because it gives me more flexibility in creating a more minimalist--but also more interactive--layout. If you're curious how something works, feel free to check out <a href="https://github.com/CadenLee2/CadenLee2.github.io/">the source code</a>.
                <br><br>I hope that the simple and clean design provides a non-distracting canvas for the more rich, colorful, and interesting ideas conveyed by images, quotes, and the rest of each page's content.
                <br><br>The website is also mobile-friendly.
