                            We will work to support the upkeep and evironmental advantages of using public transportation. Our goal as an Administration would be to set a mandate that requires all public transportation to be electric by 2040. This would improve the carbon emissions and make public transportation an even safer way for the environment to heal.

                    <!-- As a motivated and talented individual, Diego DiPasquo has spent his life advocating for positive change.
                    As early as high school, he participated in civic action projects, volunteered, and bettered his local community of Redondo Beach, California.
                    Growing up in tumultuous political times, he believed that universal issues like animal rights could unite Americans, and he saw the potential for improvement everywhere he went.
                    These beliefs soon became the foundations of his political career. -->
                    Diego DiPasquo is a candidate who can represent and relate to the people of America. Born to a family comprised of a first-generation Mexican mother and an Italian-American father, Diego spent his early years raised in Southcentral Los Angeles. While living in Southcentral, he was shown the harshness of class separation in America, further highlighted by his parents' involvement in social activist groups such as The Labor Community Strategy Center's Bus Riders Union. When Diego was five years old, his father got married to a Kenyan immigrant, which expanded his family to having 3 new African-American siblings, widening his eyes to not just the injustices of class, but also those of racial prejudice. As he got older, DiPasquo's family moved to Redondo Beach, a thriving upper-middle-class suburban neighborhood. The differences in the quality of life between the lower and middle class became all too clear to him as he spent time raised in Redondo Beach. This motivated DiPasquo to stay active in the activist groups he was raised in in LA, and even help to organize multiple Black Lives Matter rallies with his older brothers. As he left high school, DiPasquo knew he wanted to continue making a difference in his community, leading him to go to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, as Lincoln, Nebraska is one of America's biggest post-Afghanistan immigrant and refugee cities.
                    <br><br>
                    After graduating from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Diego DiPasquo attended the University of Southern California's Gould School of Law, where he specialized in environmental law and gained inspiration for his first Pulitzer Prize-winning novel.
                    Knowing that not everyone had access to the same education that he did, DiPasquo became motivated to run for local office as a city councilmember of Los Angeles, which would become his first government position.
                    He spent 8 years on the city council advocating for widely-applauded education improvements and environmental protections before being elected as the governor of California. For the past 8 years, he has been increasing funding to public schools, promoting electric vehicles and public transportation, and building new infrastructure across the state.
                    He now hopes to take his policies to the national level as President of the United States of America.
