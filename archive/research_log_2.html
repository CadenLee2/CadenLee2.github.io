                        After thinking about my <a href="research_log_1.html">possible primary sources</a>, I decided that the one I was most curious about, and that had the most potential, was the 1972 novel <i>Invisible Cities</i> by Italo Calvino. Since it's a complicated book, I'll take some time to introduce it before going into my secondary sources.
                        <br><br>
                        <i>Invisible Cities</i> follows a unique structure: in the outer frame story, traveler Marco Polo converses with the emperor Kublai Khan, describing to him the cities in his vast empire. He describes each city with poetic language in one or two pages, and they are somewhat independent of each other, meaning there is no one set order in which to read them. They are categorized into series such as "Cities and Memory", "Cities and Signs", and so on, then organized in a complicated way throughout the book's chapters, as seen in this visualization:
                        <br><br>
                        <div style="display: flex;">

                        </div>

                    <div style="width: 34%; padding-right: 2%;">
                        <img src="../static/digital_archive/images/20250416_InvisibleCitiesCopy.png" style="width: 100%;">
                        <br><span class="minihead">Above (image 1): my copy of <i>Invisible Cities</i>. The book is not too long, allowing me to reasonably analyze much of it, and its repetitive structure means I can analyze it mostly as a whole, rather than becoming too distracted by a long narrative progression</span>
                    </div>
                </div>
                To get an idea of the writing style, here is a quote:
                <br><br>
                <div class="quotebox">
                    In Ersilia, to establish the relationships that sustain the city's life, the inhabitants stretch strings from the corners of the houses, white or black or gray or black-and-white according to whether they mark a relationship of blood, of trade, authority, agency. When the strings become so numerous that you can no longer pass among them, the inhabitants leave: the houses are dismantled; only the strings and their supports remain.
                </div>
                <br>Because this book and its context was originally quite mysterious to me, I decided to find some sources then build more research questions out of those. Current scholarly sources that specifically discuss the book seem to be divided into two main lenses:
                <br>- Analysis of <b>literary style and genre</b>, reflecting how the novel fits into postmodernism and describing its structure
                <br>- Analysis of <b>history and culture</b>, especially considering how it deals with centuries-long creations of "otherness" (such as orientalism) and imperial knowledge production, as well as what culture and cities mean in an increasingly globalized world
                <br><br>After re-reading parts of the novel and looking through some sources initially, I've decided on some preliminary research questions:
                <br>- <b>What genres could the book fall under?</b> (It could be considered a conversation, a travel guide, an account, a survey of cities, or many other things; it does not directly address the reader, but it seems to involve the reader)
                <br>- <b>What does the structure accomplish?</b> (The structure above clearly makes the book an interesting read, but how does it affect the book's message?)
                <br>- <b>What historical situations and events shaped Calvino's authorship of this book?</b> (One example from my research on postmodernism so far is that 20th-century events like the World Wars, decolonization, and the Cold War shook faith in the rationality of systems like imperialism and scientific progress)
                <br>- <b>How does <i>Invisible Cities</i> use, adapt, and respond to a sense of exoticization or "othering"?</b> (What I found interesting while reading, and a common thread I saw in sources, was that through Marco Polo, Calvino seems to describe every city, including Western European ones like Paris, as equally fantastical and strange. In fact, he says that in describing all these complicated cities, he is describing his home city of Venice. This seems to contrast with Orientalism, which treats the "East" as mysterious but the "West" as rational and familiar. Much like we discussed in class, Orientalism was driven by the very kind of knowledge production that Marco Polo's original, real-life reports of Asia would have likely contributed to)

                <hr>
                I've gotten a much better understanding of <i>Invisible Cities</i> and its context from my research:
                <br>- Because "postmodernism" can be a very broad term, putting the novel in a box of "postmodern literature" to analyze it could be an overgeneralization and isn't the most productive. Some secondary sources do use the term, though, so I should look through them and determine what specific attributes are relevant to the novel.
                <br>- I've made connections between many of these sources. For instance, "The Ear Commands the Story" and "Textual Geography" both argue that the imagination and perspective of the reader is what shapes a story's meaning (leading to the consequences of Orientalism and the like)
                <br>- I understand the differences between the Khan's perspective as the ruler of an empire and Polo's perspective as a traveler (and thus how these, too, shape the meanings of the stories)
                <br><br> Overall, this process has broadened my understanding of <i>Invisible Cities</i>: before, I saw it as some kind of beautiful literary gem in isolation; now, I see how it relates to literary perspectives, the world around it, and centuries of history, opening up my ability to understand and research the text.
                <br><br>Going forward, I believe the two stylistic sources I identified first will help aid my discussion of the text by relating my ideas to the writing, but the three "History and Culture" sources will drive my main argument because they connect it to larger themes in the outside world. Because of that, for my first annotation, I will annotate Robert Ryan's article "Politics, Discourse, Empire: Framed Knowledge in Italo Calvino's <i>Invisible Cities</i>", which seems like a powerful foundation to build upon for the rest of my project.
