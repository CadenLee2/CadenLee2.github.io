                While reading Damian Duffy and John Jennings' graphic novel adaptation of <i>Parable of the Sower</i> by Octavia E. Butler, I began to consider how media and genre can affect the meaning speculative narratives have on audiences. Compared to the written word, the colorful illustrations give a different dimension and flow to the book's contents, allowing its ideas to be expressed in new ways.
                <br><br>Similarly, I notice, many recent forms of expression I've dealt with in the past few years are allowing even impossible narrative worlds to become vivid, real, and impactful in unexpected ways.

                <h1><span class="minihead"># </span> Dystopia, Horror, and Fun: <i>Lethal Company</i></h1>
                <hr>
                <div style="display: flex;">
                    <div style="width: 70%; padding-right: 2%;">
                        In the 2023 cooperative multiplayer horror game <i>Lethal Company</i>, players travel in a cramped, rusting spaceship to abandoned industrial facilities on various moons, where they scavenge for scrap to sell to a vast corporation called the Company. If the team fails to meet the profit quota, they are ejected into space and the game ends. Hardly scraping by with the money they make, and barely outrunning terrifying monsters in each facility, the players--the only human characters in the game--can take nothing for granted, not even the ability to see another day. <i>Lethal Company</i> presents a pure horror-filled dystopia. Why is it, then, that every playthrough of the game is filled with laughter?

                In the sense of worldbuilding, the player-controlled protagonists live in an entirely given world, one forced upon them, with literally no means to shape it. However, the players purchased <i>Lethal Company</i> because they were promised entertainment, so the game forces them to create their own sense of fulfillment out of this grim world.
                <br><br>
                This often comes in the form of strong teamwork, inside jokes, and exploration as players push the boundaries of the rules the game has set in place. In doing so, players themselves form a lasting sense of community and identity--that is, they build a world centered around the game's peculiarities.

                <hr>
                <div style="display: flex;">
                    <div style="width: 70%; padding-right: 2%;">
                        One of the most popular dystopian scenarios is a zombie apocalypse: beyond the reanimated dead roaming the streets, viewers' fear is often driven by the idea of utter societal collapse--no banks, hospitals, law enforcement, or government to protect victims from impending doom.
                        <br><br>
                        These very same institutions, though, are putting pressure on us every single day, often forcing us to mindlessly move through work, taxes, and other responsibilities. The 2023 Japanese anime adaptation of <i>Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead</i> uses its colorful animated medium to express a future after societal collapse, asking us what we would do if given total freedom from mundane everyday life.
                        <br><br>
                        Liberated from his oppressive office job but knowing he could die any day, protagonist Akira Tendo decides to travel across post-apocalyptic Japan and check things off his bucket list, doing everything he never had the chance to do before and living life to the fullest. In this way, he has turned a dystopia into a utopia.

                        <i>Zom 100</i>'s highly stylized animation allows entirely unrealistic, unreasonable scenarios like this one to come to life, presenting an alternate world that allows us to reflect on our own existence. Of course, a story like this would never happen; however, by juxtaposing a zombie apocalypse with a bright, uplifting attitude, each episode makes us question what's most important in our own lives, reminding us that we are more than just our societal responsibilities and inspiring us to pursue what makes us happy while we can.
                        <br><br>During difficult times, this message is a sign of hope: even if this entire world descends into chaos, there will always be ways to find fulfillment.

                        I was able to experience the two works above thanks to the Internet, a recent but transformative influence in the consumption of media. Now more than ever, our lives are flooded with alternate worlds and universes with influences from more places than ever before.
                        <br><br>The Internet allows friends to play video games together from anywhere, and it allows media from across the world to be promoted globally, but more generally, it provides anyone with an outlet to share their own thoughts and beliefs. Any time someone posts their idea, photo, or work of art, they are spreading a piece of their own world.
                        <br><br>The Internet, in this way, represents a vast and constantly-growing repository of speculative narratives, one where all it takes to find a new perspective is a bit of exploration. In fact, even this digital archive is a part of this collection.
