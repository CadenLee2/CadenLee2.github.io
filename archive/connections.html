                While reading Damian Duffy and John Jennings' graphic novel adaptation of <i>Parable of the Sower</i> by Octavia E. Butler, I began to consider how medium and genre can affect the meaning speculative narratives have on audiences. Compared to the written word, the colorful illustrations give a different dimension and flow to the book's contents, allowing its ideas to be expressed in new ways.
                <br><br>Similarly, I notice, many recent forms of expression I've dealt with in the past few years are allowing even impossible narrative worlds to become vivid, real, and impactful in unexpected ways.

                        In the 2023 cooperative multiplayer horror game <i>Lethal Company</i>, players travel in a cramped, rusting spaceship to abandoned industrial facilities on various moons, where they scavenge for scrap to sell to a vast corporation called the Company. If the team fails to meet the profit quota, they are ejected into space and the game ends. Hardly scraping by with the money they make, and barely outrunning terrifying monsters in each facility, the players--the only human characters in the game--can take nothing for granted, not even the ability to see another day. <i>Lethal Company</i> presents a pure horror-filled dystopia. Why is it, then, that every playthrough of the game is filled with laughter?

                In the sense of worldbuilding, the player-controlled protagonists live in an entirely given world, one forced upon them, with literally no means to shape it. However, players purchased <i>Lethal Company</i> because they were promised entertainment, so the game forces them to create their own sense of fulfillment out of this grim world.
                <br><br>
                This often comes in the form of strong teamwork, inside jokes, and exploration as players push the boundaries of the rules the game has set in place.

                <br><br>Left (image 2): teams of players often invent their own communication protocols to avoid getting lost, which builds a sense of community. After playing with some close friends, I found that I understood their thought processes better afterwards, even in real life.
                <br>Center (image 3): other than equipment, money can be used to purchase boomboxes and play music. In this image, players decided to test the limits of the game by filling their ship with boomboxes, amplifying the music volume and creating a funny situation.
                <br>Right: This ice cream song is a memorable track from the game that plays when supplies are ordered. Even with its rough sound design, it brings a smile to players because of its repetitive nature and how often it plays, becoming a joke in the game's community.

                        One of the most popular dystopian scenarios is a zombie apocalypse: beyond the reanimated dead roaming the streets, viewers' fear is often driven by the idea of utter societal collapse--no banks, hospitals, law enforcement, or government to protect victims from impending doom.
                        <br><br>
                        These very same institutions, though, are putting pressure on us every single day, often forcing us to mindlessly move through work, taxes, and other responsibilities. The 2023 Japanese anime adaptation of <i>Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead</i> uses its colorful animated medium to express a future after societal collapse, asking us what we would do if given total freedom from mundane everyday life.
                        <br><br>
                        Liberated from his oppressive office job but knowing he could die any day, protagonist Akira Tendo decides to travel across post-apocalyptic Japan and check things off his bucket list, doing everything he never had the chance to do before and living life to the fullest.

                        Highly stylized animation allows entirely unrealistic, unreasonable scenarios like this one to come to life, presenting an alternate world that allows us to reflect on our own existence. Of course, a story like this would never happen; however, by transforming a dystopia into a utopia, <i>Zom 100</i> makes us question what's most important in our own lives, reminding us that we are more than just our societal responsibilities and inspiring us to pursue what makes us happy while we can.
