                <!-- Ideas: Lethal Company ("Pure dystopia"), Zom 100 ("Creating utopia from dystopia": medium (anime: freedom of expression/color)), Terraforming Mars (Bruce Sterling), Anathem by Neal Stephenson (Mathematics as a Philosophy of Worldbuilding)? OR Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson (pure dystopia, loss of hope) -->
                While reading Damian Duffy and John Jennings' graphic novel adaptation of <i>Parable of the Sower</i> by Octavia E. Butler, I began to consider how medium and genre can affect the meaning speculative narratives have on audiences. Compared to the written word, the colorful illustrations give a different dimension and flow to the book's contents, allowing its ideas to be expressed in new ways.
                <br><br>Similarly, I notice, many recent forms of expression I've dealt with in the past few years are allowing even impossible narrative worlds to become vivid, real, and impactful in unexpected ways.

                        In the 2023 cooperative multiplayer horror game <i>Lethal Company</i>, players travel in a cramped, rusting spaceship to abandoned industrial facilities on various moons, where they scavenge for scrap to sell to a vast corporation called the Company. If the team fails to meet the profit quota, they are ejected into space and the game ends. Hardly scraping by with the money they make, and barely outrunning terrifying monsters, they inhabit a pure horror-filled dystopia. Why is it, then, that playthroughs of the game are filled with laughter?

                <span class="minihead">Above (video 1): a short clip of three friends in a tunnel. The player recording the video and the one in the green suit see the giant spider, but the one with the orange suit has no idea what's happening until the last second. This scene is made funnier and more terrifying by the fact that the game uses proximity chat, in which only players nearby can hear each other. Watch with sound for the full context, but be aware of loud noises.</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                In the sense of worldbuilding, the player-controlled protagonists live in an entirely given world, one forced upon them, with literally no means to shape it. However, the players purchased <i>Lethal Company</i> because they were promised entertainment, so the game forces them to create their own sense of fulfillment.
                <br><br>
                This often comes in the form of strong teamwork, inside jokes, and exploration as players push the boundaries of the rules the game has set in place. In doing so, players themselves form a lasting sense of community and identity--they build a world centered around the game's peculiarities. While doing so, they experience anticipation, sheer terror, and intense laughter at times, made more vivid by the interactivity of a multiplayer video game.

                <br><br>Left: teams of players often invent their own communication protocols to avoid getting lost. After playing with some close friends, I found that I understood their thought processes better afterwards, even in real life.
                <br><br>Center: other than equipment, money can purchase boomboxes to play music. In this image, players decided to test the limits of the game by filling their ship with boomboxes, amplifying the music volume and creating a funny, memorable situation.
                <br><br>Right: This ice cream song is a memorable track from the game that plays when supplies are ordered. Even with its rough sound design, it brings a smile to players because of its repetitive melody and how often it plays, becoming a joke in the game's community.
                <br><br>Despite the dystopian world in the game, the wider humor-filled context of its audience is comforting, a reminder that even the worst situations are more bearable when surrounded by friends. The experience made me more grateful for those around me--if I really were to be stranded in a spaceship headed to desolate moons, I would want to be by their side when confronting the horrors that await.

                        One of the most popular dystopian scenarios is a zombie apocalypse: beyond the reanimated dead roaming the streets, viewers' fear is often driven by the idea of utter societal collapse--no banks, hospitals, law enforcement, or government to protect victims from impending doom.
                        <br><br>
                        These very same institutions, though, are putting pressure on us every single day, often forcing us to mindlessly move through work, taxes, and other responsibilities. The 2023 anime adaptation of Japanese manga series <i>Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead</i> uses its colorful animated medium to express a future after societal collapse, asking us what we would do if given total freedom from mundane everyday life.

                <i>Zom 100</i>'s highly stylized animation and music allows entirely unrealistic, unreasonable scenarios like this one to come to life, presenting an alternate world--a dystopia turned utopia--that allows us to reflect on our own existence. By juxtaposing a zombie apocalypse with a bright, uplifting attitude, each episode makes us question what's most important in our own lives: our dull, tedious societal responsibilities, or the dreams we've had since childhood, both big and small. The idealism and joy expressed by these splashes of color inspires us and reminds us to think about what we really want to get out of this life before we ourselves turn to corpses.

                        I was able to experience the two works above thanks to the Internet, a recent but transformative influence in the consumption of media. Now more than ever, our lives are flooded with alternate worlds and universes with inspirations from more places than ever before.
                        <br><br>The Internet allows friends to play video games together from anywhere, it allows media from across the world to be promoted globally, and it provides an outlet to share thoughts and beliefs. In this way, the Internet represents a vast and constantly-growing repository of speculative narratives, one where all it takes to find a new perspective is a bit of exploration. In fact, even this digital archive is part of that huge collection, helping to link readers to stories and experiences that could be meaningful in their own lives.
