                        In recent Humanities Core lectures on the history of China, which have explored ways cultural works influence global audiences and have different impacts in different parts of the world, I was particularly drawn to Professor Wasserstrom's example of the three-finger salute from the Hunger Games, which has been adopted as a significant real-world symbol in some Southeast Asian protests--it's an example of how works of fiction can be referenced and used in a changing world.
                        <br><br>After reading one of science fiction author William Gibson's nonfiction articles, <i><a href="https://www.wired.com/1993/04/gibson-2/">Disneyland with the Death Penalty</a></i>, for the class, I was reminded of a book I read last summer: his 1984 novel <i>Neuromancer</i>, which has also had real-world cultural impact--not just in different places, but also in the vastly different time periods in the four decades since it has been published. <i>Neuromancer</i> follows the story of a hacker, named Case, who directly interfaces with computers through his brain; his missions take him through the decaying city streets of a near-future world, where he discovers the effects of rising technologies like artificial intelligence, computer security programs, and virtual reality.
                        <br><br>Not everyone is familiar with the novel, but its ideas have, over time, been adopted, reflected, and built upon to impact how we see the innovations of the digital age.

                Gibson did not come from a highly technical background, but he saw the world changing as new technologies, such as personal computers, began to evolve, and many terms coined in <i>Neuromancer</i> have become ways to visualize these emerging concepts:

                        <b>Matrix</b>
                        <div class="quotebox">
                            'The Matrix has its roots in primitive arcade games,' said the voice-over, 'in early graphics programs and military experimentation with cranial jacks.' (Gibson)

                        <br>
                        The matrix, in <i>Neuromancer</i>, is a graphical visualization of cyberspace, geographically and spatially organized in a way that reflects the real world. The film <i>The Matrix</i> (1999), which we watched in class, very clearly borrows and changes this idea. In <i>Neuromancer</i>, only those with the technical know-how are able to enter deep into the matrix, bypassing security and fully immersing themselves in a simulation. Meanwhile, <i>The Matrix</i> creates a world where it's the opposite: only those with enough knowledge are able to escape or rescue others from the simulation to see the real world.

                        <b>Cyberspace</b>
                        <div class="quotebox">
                            Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation (Gibson)

                        <br>
                        When <i>Neuromancer</i> was written, the Internet we know of now essentially did not exist--<i>Cyberspace</i> in the novel refers to a fictional construct, not what it means today--but we have adopted this term to describe the interconnection of computers, similar to the systems in the novel (source: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/444514" >Streeter</a>, see citation below). The word can be found <a href="https://www.oed.com/dictionary/cyberspace_n?tab=meaning_and_use#12786295">in the Oxford English Dictionary</a>.
                        <br><br><b>Biological Microchips ("Microsofts")</b>

                        </div>
                        <br><i>Neuromancer</i> increased interest in the idea of uniting people and computers together biologically which has been used in much subsequent science fiction. It is important to note that this term is unrelated to the company Microsoft, but reflects general trends of branding in computing at the time.

                In fact, Gibson's novel became a strong basis for a new subgenre of science fiction, called cyberpunk, which explores the ways technology can create dystopias.

                    <div style="width: 60%; padding-left: 2%;">
                        The 2021 film <i>Neptune Frost</i> by Anisia Uzeyman and Saul Williams draws, potentially directly and potentially indirectly, on the technological aesthetics of <i>Neuromancer</i>. The scenes where the protagonist group Unanimous Goldmine hacks into the global internet, specifically, mirror the scenes of Case "jacking in" to the matrix in <i>Neuromancer</i>, surrounded by complicated electronics.
                        <br><br>
                        However, <i>Neuromancer</i> generally covers potential impacts of this technology only on its end users, mostly in technologically developed and wealthy locations like Tokyo, North American metropolises, or cities in space, without describing where the technology comes from. <i>Neptune Frost</i>, on the other hand, is centered on the lives of the coltan miners in unstable communities whose labor is exploited for such technology to be possible. While <i>Neuromancer</i> suggests that cyberspace is for the technical elite who thrive through their their connections and contracts with corporations, <i>Neptune Frost</i> shifts the perspective of who can be a hacker, considering a potential world where technology is reclaimed by those whose labor was instrumental to producing it.
