                        In recent Humanities Core lectures, which have explored ways cultural works influence global audiences with different impacts in different parts of the world, I was particularly drawn to Professor Wasserstrom's example of the three-finger salute from the Hunger Games, which has been adopted as a significant real-world symbol in some Southeast Asian protests--it's an example of how works of fiction can be referenced and used in a changing world.
                        <br><br>After reading one of science fiction author William Gibson's nonfiction articles, <i><a href="https://www.wired.com/1993/04/gibson-2/">Disneyland with the Death Penalty</a></i>, for the class, I was reminded of a book I read last summer: his 1984 novel <i>Neuromancer</i>, which follows a hacker named Case who directly interfaces with a global network of computers through his brain. His missions take him through the decaying streets of metropolises on a near-future Earth, where he discovers the effects of rising technologies like artificial intelligence, computer implants, and virtual reality.
                        <br><br>Not everyone is familiar with the novel, but its ideas have, over time, been adopted, changed, and built upon to vastly impact how we see the innovations of the digital age, both in real life and in fiction. In fact, after I started writing this archive entry, Professor Wasserstrom actually mentioned the novel in class, describing how it reflects views of the future during the 1980s.

                Gibson did not come from a highly technical background, but he saw the world changing as new technologies, such as personal computers, began to evolve, and many terms coined in <i>Neuromancer</i> have become ways to visualize emerging concepts.

                        The Matrix, in <i>Neuromancer</i>, is a graphical visualization of cyberspace, geographically and spatially organized in a way that reflects the real world. The film <i>The Matrix</i> (1999), which we watched in class, very clearly borrows and builds upon this idea. In <i>Neuromancer</i>, only those with the technical know-how are able to enter deep into the Matrix, bypassing security and fully immersing themselves in a simulation. Meanwhile, <i>The Matrix</i> creates a world where it's the opposite: only those with enough knowledge are able to escape or extract others out of the simulation to see the real world.

                        When <i>Neuromancer</i> was written in 1984, the Internet we know of now essentially did not exist--<i>Cyberspace</i> in the novel refers to a fictional construct where the world's computers are linked together--but we have since adopted this term to describe the real-life interconnection of computers similar to the systems in the novel (source: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/444514" >Streeter</a>, see citation below). The word can be found <a href="https://www.oed.com/dictionary/cyberspace_n?tab=meaning_and_use#12786295">in the Oxford English Dictionary</a> and shows how, thanks to the book, we now see the Internet as a space of its own.

                        <br><i>Neuromancer</i> popularized the idea of uniting people and computers together biologically, a concept since used in much subsequent science fiction. It is important to note that this term is unrelated to the name of the company Microsoft, but does still reflect general naming trends in business at the time.

                <br>
                In fact, Gibson's novel became a strong basis for a rising subgenre of science fiction called cyberpunk, which explores ways like these that technology can create dystopias and heterotopias. This genre grew in significance along with computers and the Internet itself over time, and we can see traces of <i>Neuromancer</i> in countless subsequent works.

                        The 2021 Afrofuturist film <i>Neptune Frost</i> by Anisia Uzeyman and Saul Williams indirectly draws on the technological aesthetics of <i>Neuromancer</i>. Specifically, the scenes where the protagonist group Unanimous Goldmine hacks into the global internet mirror the moments when <i>Neuromancer</i>'s protagonist Case "jacks in" to cyberspace, surrounded by complicated electronics to physically and mentally connect with the machines.
                        <br><br>
                        However, <i>Neuromancer</i> generally covers this futuristic technology only in relation to users in technologically developed and wealthy locations like Tokyo, North American metropolises, or cities in space, without describing where the technology comes from. <i>Neptune Frost</i>, on the other hand, is centered on the lives of the coltan miners in unstable communities whose labor and resources are exploited for such technology to be possible. While <i>Neuromancer</i> has created a popular picture of cyberspace being for the technical elite who thrive through their their connections and contracts with corporations, <i>Neptune Frost</i> shifts the perspective of who can be a hacker, considering a potential world where technology is reclaimed by those whose labor was instrumental to producing it.

                        Given its depiction of a futuristic world that somewhat romanticizes the role of a computer hacker, it makes sense for the novel to be popular in communities like programming and cybersecurity. In fact, I was initially interested in it partly because I had seen various <i>Neuromancer</i> quotes in the profiles of users of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions">StackOverflow</a>, a question and answer forum for computer programmers.
                        <br><br>Considering how much of its content really has become prevalent in society--a global network of computers, a form of artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and so on--many technologists are enthusiastic about Gibson's ideas, viewing him as a prophet and hoping to directly bring about the technology from his books. However, Gibson himself does not come from this background and is not necessarily supportive of such literal adoption of his work.
                        <br><br>For example, in 1988, the Autodesk company tried to <a href="https://blog.jtbworld.com/2007/01/autodesk-trademarked-cyberspace.html">create a virtual reality product called Cyberspace</a> inspired by Gibson and attempted to trademark the word. In response, he "'threatened to sue' the company, suspecting 'that technical people who like [his] work miss several layers of irony'" (Cavallaro). Other fans have tried to create "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzEd50uzdF0">cyberdecks</a>" like those in the novel, but with no exact description, these are hard to define and are essentially up to interpretation. A trading firm has named itself <a href="https://wintermute.com/">Wintermute</a> in reference to an AI from the book, trying to convey that they are on the leading edge of technology despite having little in common with the book's AI.
                        <br><br>Such interactions question the line between predictions and metaphors across science fiction: on one hand, science fiction is based in <i>science</i>, logically imagining worlds that could unfold from our current one; on the other, science fiction is <i>fiction</i>, using its imagined worlds not just as literal statements about the future, but also as symbols and settings that make us think deeper about life or the world today.
                        <br><br>Like with any work of science fiction, not everything in <i>Neuromancer</i> is literal, prophetic, and fated to exist. Regardless, though, the novel--and the cyberpunk genre that it helped bring about--still serves as a source of creative inspiration, getting people interested in the future of technology and the aesthetics such a future might hold.
