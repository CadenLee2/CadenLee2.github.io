                    Boccaccio's <i>Decameron</i>, written in the 14th century after the 1348 pandemic, describes a group of seven women and three men who have ran from the plague-infested city of Florence to the countryside. During their time there, they tell tales to each other. Within those tales--and within the book as a whole--Boccaccio argues for the importance of imagination, creativity, and other human qualities and experiences, rather than the divine, religious subjects of his contemporaries.
                    <br><br>
                    To outline his system in the preface, he speaks from the point of view of the book's Author:
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="quotebox">
                        My plan is to recount one hundred stories, or fables, or parables, or histories, or whatever you wish to call them. [...] In reading them, <span class="tooltip">the ladies of whom I have been speaking<span class="tooltiptext">The Author claims to sympathize with women, aiming to save them when they have nothing else to do inside their homes</span></span> will be able to derive not only pleasure from the entertaining material they contain, but useful advice as well [...] and I believe that as they read them, their suffering would come to an end (4-5).

                    <div style="width: 70%; padding-left: 2%;">
                        Rather than tell these stories outright, Boccaccio (speaking as the Author) presents them through the ten characters. Known as a pastoral setting, their idyllic countryside surroundings reflect his virtues and the world the group has built for themselves, as opposed to the much more grim outside world.
                        <br><br>Similarly, he hopes that his audience will find escape and salvation in the literary world he creates.

                    Boccaccio's system creates a multi-layered framework that characterizes the <i>Decameron</i>'s storytelling.

                    Boccaccio's work reflects one way that we design and categorize spaces. Similar to how the <i>Decameron</i> is just a sequence of words but contains a multi-dimensional structure, the universe we live in is relatively flat and continuous but can be split into nested layers. Each of these could be seen as its own world, with its own attributes, histories, and purposes.

                    When deciding whether UCI is an isolated, pastoral world of its own or a liminal space, I think of it like reading the <i>Decameron</i> : each sub-world I inhabit is practically cut off from the outside until I leave. Going from my room to the library is like switching chapters, and taking a weekend trip off campus is like closing the book, leaving the stories for when I return.

                    This style of categorization is especially apparent to us when we use computers--the design of graphical user interfaces heavily employs visual distinctions between layers for navigation. For instance, every UCI undergraduate uses the Canvas learning management system, as seen in the image:
                    <br><br>

                            <br>2. Most web browsers use tabs, each of which contains a different website's world
                            <br>3. In Canvas, the page is split into various regions, like the Dashboard and the To Do list
                            <br>4. As a liminal space, the Dashboard displays a list of courses (similar to Boccaccio's frame for presenting stories)
                            <br>5. The entire world of each course visually resides within its corresponding box, waiting to be clicked
