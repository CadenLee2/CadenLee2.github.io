                    Because I'm in a different seminar section now, I'd like to clarify how I chose to develop my site. As a computer science student, in fall quarter I opted to program my website from scratch rather than using Google Sites because it gives me more flexibility in creating a more minimalist--but also more interactive--layout. 
                    <br><br>Considering that we learned in class about the perceived divide between the sciences and the humanities, I am even more motivated this quarter to use my web development skills to bridge that gap.
                    <br><br>This should not change the way you access the site, but you can expect a slightly different appearance from other archives. If you're curious about the technical details, see the section called "Design Note" on <a href="../digitalarchive.html">my homepage</a>. This website is also mobile-friendly.

                        For my spring quarter research project in Humanities Core, I have to choose a primary source to investigate. Across the quarter, I will work on an essay contributing to a related scholarly conversation, centering my research on the source and its context. Because of this, the source I choose is important.
                        <br><br>When deciding, I thought about both my interests and the topics we learned about in class. To make sure I cover multiple types of sources, I considered:
                        <br>- Books I've recently read (inside and outside of class)
                        <br>- Music genres I like
                        <br>- Images that impacted me
                        <br>- Games I've played
                        <br>- Places I want to know more about
                        <br>- Movies I've watched
                        <br><br>The following three sources are ones that I think are interesting, but I'm considering others as well.
                        <br><br><span class="minihead">Right (image 1): it's hard to choose when there are so many interesting topics and sources! (Note: I always list full image credits at the very bottom of the page)</span>

                        <b>1972 ‚Ä¢ Novel ‚Ä¢ Postmodernism ‚Ä¢ Magical Realism</b>
                        <br><br>
                        In eleventh grade, my friend recommended that I read <i>Invisible Cities</i>, a 1972 novel by the Italian author Italo Calvino. I had never heard of the novel, but a year later, I obtained and started reading it; I was quickly lost in a maze of words and concepts, beautiful yet confusing.
                        <br><br>
                        <div class="quotebox">
                            Arriving at each new city, the traveler finds again a past of his that he did not know he had: the foreignness of what you no longer are or no longer possess lies in wait for you in foreign, unpossessed places (Calvino)
                        </div>
                        <br>In the book, the explorer Marco Polo visits the emperor Kublai Khan and tells him stories of the cities he experienced on his travels. Each city is described in a page or two, with very abstract but internally consistent sentences like the one above, and there are 55 in total. He mentions that, in describing all of these cities, he is actually describing Venice.
                        <br><br>I was reminded of the book when reading Plato's <i>Republic</i>, which similarly builds a city whose complexities reflect philosophical views of the world, despite being written much longer ago, and it definitely connects to our course's worldbuilding theme.
                        <br><br><span class="minihead">Right and above (image 2): complicated cities lie behind a simple cover</span>
                    </div>
                    <div style="width: 30%; padding-right: 2%;">

                </div>
                <br>
                Because this book was written in the 1970s, and I'm not very familiar with postmodernism, I'd want to do historical and genre analysis. I went into reading with very little understanding of the context and audience, so that would help my understanding. I could also include my own interpretations of the novel's literary style--certain sentences, like the one quoted above, stood out to me stylistically as I was reading. To get started, I can find many scholarly sources discussing the novel and Calvino's work as a whole from a quick search on <a href="https://www.jstor.org/action/doBasicSearch?Query=invisible+cities&so=rel">JSTOR</a>. I can already imagine countless aspects to include in my research:
                <br><br><b>Cities as inspirations? ‚Ä¢ Exoticization of foreign cities? ‚Ä¢ Finding unfamiliarity in familiar social structures? ‚Ä¢ How this exemplifies postmodern literature? ‚Ä¢ Language versus meaning? ‚Ä¢ The complicated narrative structure? Audience reception of the book?</b>

                        <br><br>The director, Makoto Shinkai, has created many recent films similarly featuring young protagonists dealing with natural disaster. Because it was a popular film internationally, the audience is not limited to Japan, and typically seems to include a wide range of people interested in animation, weather, cities, and other themes in the film.

                        <br><br>
                        As a much more recent primary source, the 2019 Japanese animated film <i>Weathering with You</i> also has a strong sense of worldbuilding, exploring a changing climate (based on the reality of climate change) and myths related to the weather (based on the supernatural) when a boy runs away from his rural home to Tokyo, where meets a girl who can change the weather. I was instantly drawn to the film's detailed aesthetics and its mixing of ideas.
                        <br><br><img src="https://thebreakthrough.imgix.net/weathering-with-you-3-big.jpg" style="width: 100%;">

                    </div>
                </div>
                <br>I would like to research the real-life mythology and folklore that went into this film, specifically when it comes to the "weather maidens" who are able to change the weather, and how this connects to the social perception of climate change. I am also interested in the symbolism of the gun that appears in parts, as despite its small size it plays a large and serious role in the plot.
                <br><br>
                Research would involve film analysis, possibly rhetorical analysis, and style analysis, considering the distinctive visual style. Again, I can find scholarly sources discussing either the film or the director.
                <br><br>
                <b>Globalization and modernity? ‚Ä¢ Symbolism of the gun? ‚Ä¢ How folklore accompanies scientific advancement? ‚Ä¢ Perceptions of rain and weather in media? ‚Ä¢ Effectiveness of the story at representing these ideas?</b>

                <hr>

                        <b>2019 ‚Ä¢ Visual Art ‚Ä¢ Post-Internet</b>
                        <br><br>
                        While recently looking at art related to the Internet, I came across the Post-Internet movement, which aesthetically analyzes the Internet's impacts on humanity. Artist Josh Rowell's <i>Virtually Fragile</i> series (see the image to the right) stood out to me because the image of a broken screen is instantly recognizable in the twenty-first century, but his work's physicality as an acrylic painting, despite fundamentally being about digital concepts, is a reversal of the fact that our lives are becoming increasingly tied to computers.
                        <br><br>According to <a href="https://www.joshrowell.co.uk/about">his website</a>, Rowell is an international artist with exhibitions and art community audiences in numerous different countries. He has a Master of Fine Arts from Kingston Art School in the United Kingdom.
                        <br><br>Despite the fact that I could not find scholarly articles directly mentioning him, he has left a visible impact with several major museums, and because his themes include extremely prevalent topics, I believe I could find highly related scholarly research. It would be interesting to contribute an analysis of his work to the scholarly conversation surrounding Post-Internet art.
                    </div>
                    <div style="width: 45%; padding-right: 2%;">

                        <br><span class="minihead">Above (image 4): "Virtually Fragile #6" mimics the appearance of a broken screen, but it is painted with acrylic on wood.</span>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <br>Research topics might include the history of computing and the Internet, the usage of broken screens in media, and Post-Internet art (about which there is much scholarly discourse). I would likely explore how this art series creates a depiction of our present world and how technology shapes it. While this work is very directly tied to the present day, regardless of what I research, I do want to connect it to current issues--I know that humanistic expression can take on meaning about life beyond the context in which it was produced.
                <br><br>
