                <hr>
                Though the Humanities Core lectures helped me understand <i>Soy Cuba</i>, the film still left me with many questions.
                One way to seek answers to these questions is using secondary sources, which provide more historical context, analysis, and interconnections on a level above the original work.
                <br><br>Interested in the aesthetic of the film, I first turned to Rosalind Galt's book <i>Pretty: Film and the Decorative Image</i>, which includes a section analyzing <i>Soy Cuba</i>'s varying degrees of success and how it portrays the beauty of revolution.
                However, secondary sources themselves require active reading, too.
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h1><span class="minihead"># </span> Selecting a Secondary Source</h1>

                <div style="display: flex;">
                    <div style="width: 50%; padding-right: 2%;">
                        <b>Without a list or idea</b>

                        <input type="text" placeholder="üîç Google can be helpful..."></input>
                        <style>
                            input {
                                width: 100%;
                                padding: 8px;
                                border-radius: 4px;
                                border: none;
                                background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)
                            }
                        </style>
                        <br>
                        I often create, even if just mentally, a list of key terms, dates, and ideas surrounding my topic before looking for sources. For instance, I might list:
                        <br>- 1964 (the date of <i>Soy Cuba</i>), or the 1960s in general
                        <br>- Soy Cuba
                        <br>- Film techniques
                        <br>- Relations between Cuba, the US, and the USSR
                        <br>- The Cuban Revolution
                        <br>- Perception of Cuban culture
                        <br><br>
                        I can then combine various terms from this list and use general search engines (like Google) or library search features (like UCI's library websites) to find sources. Sometimes, websites themselves may not be the best sources, but they could list more academic sources somewhere on the page.
                        <br><br>

                        <br><br>
                        Luckily, this unit's essay prompt gave a helpful list of seconary sources relating to the film.
                        <br><br>
                        1. <b>Titles</b>: does any title catch my eye? What specific topics do I think the source will cover, or is the title very general? I chose to look into <i>Pretty</i> because it sounded like it dealt heavily with aesthetic aspects of film
                        <br><br>
                        2. <b>Dates</b>: what are the oldest and newest sources, and how do they relate to the topic being covered? All the sources in the list were relatively recent, in the past decade or two, compared to how long ago <i>Soy Cuba</i> was made.
                        <br><br>
                        3. <b>Length and density</b>: if a source looks like it will be a quick read, I'm more likely to check it out first, but if it looks dense, I would need to look into it more before starting

                <h1><span class="minihead"># </span> Reading and Notetaking</h1>
                <hr>
                Though I typically prefer to download a PDF, if allowed, and use <a href="https://okular.kde.org/">my preferred PDF viewer</a> for reading, some sources are only available on websites. Regardless, I rarely annotate directly on the document.
                <br><br>
                Because of my experience with programming, I like to take notes in a standardized plain-text format called Markdown that is simple, can be easily shared, and doesn't take up much storage space.
                Splitting the notes up into the sub-sections of the chapters helps me understand the organization the author wants to convey.
                <br><br>
                When I find a key piece of evidence, important point, or guiding piece of information, I summarize or quote it in the corresponding section of my notes and make sure to note the page number.
                If I find words I'm uncertain about or that seem very particular to the source, I bold them by putting double asterisks around them (see the example below).
                Sometimes, I need to define terms or ideas, often using a Wikipedia page and including a link so I can access it again. Of course, to actually use that material in an essay,
                I would have to check Wikipedia's sources section and use a source from there.
                <br><br>
                My typical notes look like:
                <div class="codebox-md">

                    <br>- 215: evidence that it actually played for 2 weeks, longer than most
                    <br>- 217: some reviewers admire its cinematic quality: Beltran says it uses "acercamiento"/closeness instead of <span class="cbmd-b">**Brechtian distanciation**</span>

                I can then go back and check out key points and ideas to use in my essay or project. The bolded terms are especially likely to be helpful, because if they were unfamiliar to me,
                this means the source is offering new information I wouldn't have found elsewhere, making it useful. Because I included page numbers, I can look back at anything interesting and find more details, like other sources used.

                <hr>
                The modern ability to discover and choose interests using the Internet can also have downsides, though, like addiction due to manipulative recommendation algorithms. One way some artists have chosen to respond is by taking advantage of technology to spread awareness of such problems--another way that art and the Internet can intersect.
                <br><br>
                For instance, net artist <a target="_blank" href="https://bengrosser.com/projects">Ben Grosser</a> created a project called <a target="_blank" href="https://bengrosser.com/projects/stuck-in-the-scroll/">Stuck in the Scroll</a> that displays in real time his addiction to social media app TikTok's endless scroll feature.
                <br><br>

                    <div style="width: 58%; margin-left: 2%;">
                        <div class="quotebox">Think of this work as a last-ditch effort, a sort of public confessional as therapeutic tool aimed at defusing the intense compulsion I feel every day to endlessly scroll the world‚Äôs most popular video app (Grosser)</div>

                <br>
                Projects like this one are accessible due to the very same thing that they criticize and examine: the instantaneous nature of today's world. Much like how Titus Kaphar transforms historical paintings as a way of giving viewers new points of view, net artists repurpose technologies typically used for work, entertainment, or profit to reveal how those technologies are drastically influencing everyday life. As new issues keep emerging in this changing world, so will new art, new mediums, and new perspectives.
