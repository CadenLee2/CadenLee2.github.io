                    <hr>
                    In Book 9 of Homer's poem The Odyssey, Odysseus has received food and drink from the Phaeacians, and after stating his name, he begins telling them a story as a gift--and as a way to manipulate them into giving him many gifts and a safe passage home. His description of his encounter with a cyclops provides multiple stories in one: on the surface, he uses rhetoric to make himself a hero, and beyond that, a story of theft and greed.

                        Having lost everything in a rough sea journey, Odysseus's goal is to build himself up in the eyes of the Phaeacians, gain many gifts from them, and return home as a successful hero. To do so, he relies on their assumptions, or "warrants", as Professor Alexander describes in the Humanities Core handbook, of how civilized people should act. By portraying the cyclops as brutal and uncivilized, Odysseus provides an opposite example and strengthens the bonds between him and the Phaeacians, while simultaneously turning himself into a hero.

                        Through his carefully-chosen descriptions of the cyclops Polyphemus, Odysseus justifies his actions, which include stealing the cyclops' cheese and sheep, deceiving him, and blinding him.

                    Xenia is the Greek ritual of hospitality, whose stages are meant to be followed in a specific order.
                    <br><br>Odysseus uses this to his advantage through the story, hoping to both illustrate the cyclops' uncivlized nature and inspire the Phaeacians to be courteous to him.
                    <br><br>However, analyzing his own actions reveals that he, too, disrespected Xenia multiple times.

                            Odysseus' actions provide evidence that he was the one in the wrong through this interaction; as mentioned in our discussion sections, his greed may have been part of a colonizer's mentality, or a psychological response to the trauma of the Trojan War. Like most of the class, I disagree with his actions.
                            <br><br>However, his strengths in storytelling remain inspirational to me. As an example of effective rhetoric--after all, Odysseus got what he wanted--this story reveals how even when one has lost everything tangible, words are still a powerful asset.
