                    <hr>
                    This page is simply a collection of my thoughts as a computer science student reading Plato's <i>Republic</i> for the first time.
                    <br><br>For ease of writing, I assume readers are familiar with the dialogue and with the basics of computers.
                    <br><br>Be careful reading, since this page is still in progress.

                    <br>What is this thing?
                    <br>- A sequence of zeroes and ones
                    <br>- A giant number
                    <br>- A text file
                    <br>- A small image
                    <br>- The encoded answer to the most important question of your life
                    <br><br>It could be any of the above.
                    <br><br>A <b>turing machine</b> is a theoretical machine which reads and writes an infinitely long strip of zeroes and ones. Going one cell at a time, following the rules it is given, the machine is able to implement any computer algorithm. Devised in the mid-20th century by mathematician Alan Turing, it has become the basis for our definition of computing.
                    <br><br>Today, when we think of computers, we don't think in terms of zeroes and ones; we think in terms of music apps, messages on social media, and search bars. That is, we build <b>abstractions</b> on top of a basic binary foundation.

                    <h1><span class="minihead"># </span> The Forms and Dualism</h1>
                    <hr>
                    While Plato places the most authenitc, true entities, the realities of things, which he calls the Forms, highest on the vertical line of existence, and mere shadows or replicas lowest, computer scientists do the opposite: we call the most basic fundamentals <b>low-level</b> and the abstractions <b>high-level</b>. In between, countless layers make up the way software and systems are developed and run.
                    <br><br>For example:
                    <br>
                    <br>1 ("highest" level): When we open up a music player and choose a song, most of us think of just that: we click on a "song", and the computer "plays it".
                    <br>2 (lower level): By clicking on the button that represents a song, the music player program opens a file in our file structure, then uses a library to read the file and instruct the system to play it
                    <br>3: To open the file, the music player's code calls the application programming interface (API) for a filesystem library
                    <br>4: The filesystem library uses system calls to directly access the file
                    <br>5: Machine code is executed
                    <br>6 ("lowest" level): The binary data stored in the computer is changing
                    <br>
