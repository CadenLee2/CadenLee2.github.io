                <br><br>
                When approaching the topic of wellbeing in the past, I've often designated certain times in my daily routine for me to destress, think to the future, or take my mind off of difficult tasks: I walk thirty minutes to the gym and back in the morning, for instance; when I have time I read before bed; and I hike every Saturday with UCI's Hiking Club. However, these are actions that also serve some other direct purpose beyond wellbeing (like going to the gym, getting through a book, or meeting people through a hike). I rarely used to set aside time for wellbeing alone.
                <br><br>
                So when doing my first nature walk, I found that my purpose was different from before. It wasn't to get fresh air while heading to the gym, or to enjoy nature while talking; rather, it was purely my state of wellbeing. It took effort to not do what I normally do. I had to force myself to walk at a slow pace rather than a brisk one, and I avoided looking around to see whether any of my friends were outside. Instead, I focused on details like the falling leaves and the squirrels in the branches. During the walk, thoughts of what I'd do afterwards arose in my mind--upcoming homework assignments, songs I wanted to listen to, people I wanted to message--and I intentionally pushed them down. It was a kind of slow time, a time that stretched out and felt much longer, the exact opposite of the hours that rush by when I'm heavily active. Compared to how I used to idly look at my phone or read a news article when I was bored, I think this kind of intentional wellbeing activity cleared my mind, allowing me to unconsciously think more carefully about what I would do when I was finished. After my walk, I returned to my room and felt an increased sense of purpose to complete these activities, becoming much more productive and less distracted.
                <br><br>
                The same thing has happened each time: whether walking in nature, sitting and taking in the various elements, or journaling, I increasingly allowed my mind to sharpen with fewer distractions. In fact, rather than feeling like they were taking away my time, these activities actually became increasingly helpful as I became more busy throughout the quarter. This allowed me to quickly see the material benefits of wellbeing practice.
                <br><br>
                Beyond productivity and focus, it's difficult to say whether this process has directly improved my mental state, since this quarter has been different in various ways (more stress about job prospects, more time spent going out with friends, easier course workloads, and so on). However, I'm inclined to believe that the wellbeing activities have helped me mentally, even if that pathway is indirect. With my newfound understanding of careful, intentional action, I think it's easier for me to limit things that are detrimental to my health (like scrolling on social media) and spend longer on things that I enjoy (like reading books).
                <br><br>
                The careful nature of wellbeing also links into my understanding of the humanities: in a fast-paced world that seemingly offers no time to think or ask questions, it's easy to toss details aside as irrelevant. In a situation specifically focused on details, though, like a nature walk, it becomes clear that details are beautiful and critical. Like we discussed in an in-class reflection during Week 9, in the humanities there is no detail too small or unimportant.
                <br><br>
                I agree that wellbeing is an important part of education, because it could allow students like me to think more carefully and intentionally about not only their learning but also their lives. A process of graded and scheduled activities like this one is a strong introduction because it enforces practice rather than merely suggesting it. If such a process was implemented in younger grades, such as in high school or middle school, it might have an even greater impact.
                <br><br>
                Overall, I'm grateful for the opportunity to participate in these activities and I will continue them into the future.
