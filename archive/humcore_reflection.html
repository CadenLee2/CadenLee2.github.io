                Before coming to UCI, my experience with writing classes was relatively simple. Rather than presenting large, complex topics and varied arguments surrounding them, my middle school and early high school English classes would follow rigorous patterns: the entire class would study a singular primary source for several weeks, often being pushed to think about the topic in a certain one-sided direction. We would analyze style alone, or history alone, and the resulting essays tended to sound quite monotonous, following the required five-paragraph structure while praising the source for its "strong use of diction" and "vivid figurative language". Even in AP English Language & Composition, a class that claimed to value complexity, we were driven to write theses with only two sides, a kind of binary opposition, one more weighted than the other: "while A is the case, B is more significantly the case". Perfecting that kind of essay was straightforward, because it was the kind of essay that inherently <i>could</i> be perfected.
                <br><br>
                Humanities Core has helped slowly (but sometimes surprisingly) ease us into the process of more genuinely complex humanistic analysis. I remember expecting a high-school analysis of The Odyssey: a one-sided claim that its literary style showcases the might of Odysseus' feats. But instead, we began to focus on his audience, on his goals, on the way he abuses his perspective as the victor, and went beneath the text to subvert it.
                <br><br>
                Since then, we've gained the analytical skills necessary for this kind of complicated analysis, and we've expanded our breadth to interweaving concepts of ideology, race, history, and the like, including very personal narratives like the history of Asian American immigration (something I had never covered in such depth before). More importantly, though, we've gained the ability to <i>question</i>.
                <br><br>
                When first starting my <a href="./research_presentation.html">research project</a> on <i>Invisible Cities</i>, I wasn't sure what to argue--I looked to scholarly articles as I assessed the landscape, and they spread out a wide mess of ideas. But this was the kind of free, open-ended start I had prepared for all along, the moment that broke completely with the guidance of high school. I not only drew on the work of other scholars, but also questioned them, expanding on their limitations and personally reading into the source to reveal new possibilities. I also drew on the concepts we had learned in lecture, many of which were highly fitting (Orientalism, words like "ontological", and so on). What resulted from this process of exploration, uncertainty, and questioning was an argument that developed the novel from a small interest I had to a vast landscape of shifting cities, imperial visions, concepts of resistance, and chessboards that subvert their own structure.
                <br><br>
                Especially in our final few units that deal with the nature of space, including space close to home like the UCI campus, I now see how ideology shapes everything around us, even if we are unaware of it. I'm now willing to question assumptions and look deeper into contradictions rather than sealing them up under a guise of one-sidedness. Whether listening to music, reading books, or walking across campus, I'm able to think of more than what's on the surface--and in that way, I'm able to better appreciate the contradictions and interconnections of everything around me, to enrich my experience of life.
