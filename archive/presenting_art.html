                <hr>
                After exploring the works of Sanford Biggers, Titus Kaphar, and Carrie Mae Weems through multiple lectures and seminars, I'm much more familiar with their work--but I say that without ever seeing their art, which is fundamentally very physical, in person. Instead, I've seen photos and videos--no matter how high-resolution, they are still just representations.
                <br><br>I realize that the way art is presented to us strongly affects the way we see it. Considering how wide an audience the Internet can be, I decided to investigate how Titus Kaphar specifically presents his art online, as opposed to in a museum.

                        In a physical museum, visitors are guided by the physical shape of the rooms and doorways, navigating through one continuous space. If they go to every room in an installation, they likely see every work of art, and choose which ones to spend more time studying.

                        By moving through the room, viewers also inherently look from different angles and distances, allowing them to naturally focus on different details over time.

                        In a website, visitors rely on interactive design cues to navigate, such as a menu bar, images that can be hovered, spacing, and colors. Each image or link acts as a portal to a more detailed page, allowing the user to choose which topics they want to see more of, while hiding the rest.

                        In a browser, it is possible to zoom in or open images in new tabs; however, this is a conscious and specific action. Normally it is up to the website designers to choose which details to highlight by default. In Kaphar's website, clicking on an image makes it take up the full screen.
